# Roadmap

This is a loose list of features I'd like to implement into `prosemirror-dev-toolkit`.

- track appendedTransactions. Because it's a must.
- improve the injection script (basically enhance the hack to gain access to view)
- enhance structure tab on large docs. It could be faster
- add tab to execute commands. Basically a (primitive) prosemirror REPL
- make Chrome extension

No time scales set. Just for reference for my and your's sake.
