# ProseMirror dev toolkit

Since the `prosemirror-dev-tools` library has gotten a bit behind the times, I decided to remake the library. Instead of JS, this library uses TS and tries also to minimize the installed module size (`prosemirror-dev-tools` is 200 MBs(!) in total inside `node_modules`). Also there's a couple of annoying warnings that I want to remove and just make it a little bit more convenient to use.

```sh
npm i prosemirror-dev-toolkit
```

## How to run locally
